I am a PhD candidate in Economics at Georgia Institute of Technology, where my research focuses on developmental economics. My work is particularly centered around gender equality, non-marital cohabitation and marriage transitions, aiming to uncover how relationship changes influence well-being over time.

Before starting my PhD, I completed my Economics and Finance Bachelor Degree in a dual-degree program at University of West Alabama and Guangdong University of Finance, where I developed a strong foundation in Stata, R, and EViews. During my PhD, I also obtained my Masterâ€™s in Economics from Georgia Institute of Technology.
